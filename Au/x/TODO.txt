Add these functions and classes. All are in QM2.

computer:
	isLoggedOn. Maybe .NET has it, eg Environment.UserName/UserInteractive.
	getIpAddress. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6803073/get-local-ip-address
	getDiskUsage.
DetectStringEncoding.

Review functions/classes in QM2 Archive. Now reviewed all in qm.exe and System.

CONSIDER
