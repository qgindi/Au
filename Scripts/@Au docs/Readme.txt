Us the latest DocFX. Older version may not support new C# features.
If there are some strange errors, likely DocFX uses wrong SDK version. Try to temporarily rename folders of SDKs that should not be used.

info: we don't use the full text search feature.
	Uses CPU 10-20 s after each page [re]load.
	Results are poorly sorted.
	The Google site search does it much better, and often faster.
	info: To enable it, add "_enableSearch": true in "globalMetadata".
