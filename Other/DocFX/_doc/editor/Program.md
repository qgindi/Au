In the main window: code editor, several panels, toolbars and menu bar. Also there is a tray icon. The main window can be hidden, it depends on program settings.

## Code editor
Here you edit automation scripts and other text files.
[Features](xref:code_editor).

Multiple files can be open, but only one is visible. The list of open files is in the Open panel.

All changes are saved automatically on these events: app deactivated, main window closed, timer. The Save button saves all changes immediately.

## Panels
Panels and toolbars can be docked, floating or hidden.

### Files
All files and folders of current workspace.

Click an item to open in the code editor. Right-click to show context menu. Middle-click to close. Drag and drop to reorder or add new files.

All changes are saved automatically.

C# code files have .cs extension, but it is hidden. Yellow background if the file is open in the code editor.

Deleted files and folders are moved to the Recycle Bin if possible. To restore a file or folder, find it there and restore; then find in File Explorer and drag and drop to the Files panel.

File properties are documented in the Properties dialog.

Files are of these types:
- Script - C# code file that can be executed directly, like a program.
- Class - C# code file that cannot be executed directly but contains code used by other files.
- Text files - txt, xml and other files that can be edited in the code editor.
- Other files - files that cannot be edited. Images etc. For example can be added to assembly resources.

Folders are of these types:
- simple folders.
- folders named like <i>@Project</i> are [project](xref:class_project) folders.

The collection of files and folders is a *workspace*. It is a folder on disk. In the folder:
- the **files** folder contains files and folders of the workspace.
- the **files.xml** file is the list of files and folders of the workspace.
